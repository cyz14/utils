# utils

Utilities for NF developer setup/etc

## Creating a Developer environment with `vagrant`

1. Clone this repository, [MoonGen](//github.com/williamofockham/MoonGen), and
   [NetBricks](//github.com/williamofockham/NetBricks) into the same parent
   directory.
   ```shell
   $ for repo in utils MoonGen NetBricks; do \
       git clone https://github.com/williamofockham/${repo}.git; \
     done
   ```
2. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) and
   [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
3. Install the `vagrant-disksize` (required) and `vagrant-vbguest` (recommended)
   `vagrant-reload` (required) plugins:
   ```shell
   $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize vagrant-vbguest vagrant-reload
   ```
4. Boot the VM:
   ```shell
   $ cd utils
   $ vagrant up
   ```

The above steps will prepare your virtual machine with all of the appropriate
DPDK settings (multiple secondary NICs, install kernel modules, enable huge
pages, bind the extra interfaces to DPDK drivers) and the sandbox Docker image.

If you have MoonGen and NetBricks cloned as described in step 1 above, those
repositories will be shared into the VM at `/MoonGen` and `/NetBricks`
respectively.

## Design of our Docker images

```
ubuntu/xenial                        (upstream)
+- williamofockham/dpdk              (container-friendy DPDK build)
   +- williamofockham/sandbox        (base image, copies in MoonGen)
   /  +- williamofockham/netbricks   (NFV framework)
+- williamofockham/moongen           (traffic/packet generator)

```

Most times you will want to run the `williamofockham/netbricks` container, which
includes all of the other tools. This is started by default in the Vagrant setup.

The goal of our structure here is to avoid requiring rebuilding each of the
frameworks every time. We use multi-staged image builds based on
`ubuntu/xenial`, which is the same as the host OS in the Vagrant setup above.
The `williamofockham/dpdk` image is built in this repository from the contents
of the `dpdk` directory, and the `williamofockham/sandbox` image is built from
the `Dockerfile.sandbox` in the root directory. The other images are built from
their respective repositories.

Because DPDK has a lot of requirements from the host OS, many files and
directories are mounted into the container, which also runs in "privileged"
mode. The following mounts are required (and handled in most `docker.mk` files
in our repositories):

```
# Kernel modules and headers
/lib/modules
/usr/src

# Access to the host PCI bus
/sys/bus/pci/drivers

# Access to huge pages
/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages

# Access to NUMA configuration
/sys/devices/system/node

# Enumerating kernel modules
/sbin/modinfo
/bin/kmod
/sbin/lsmod

# Device nodes
/dev

# Huge-pages filesystem
/mnt/huge

# Sharing DPDK runtime configuration or unix sockets
/var/run
```

## [DEPRECATED] Creating Docker host with `corectl` (Mac)

*NOTE*: We are no longer using `corectl` because getting proper DPDK
compatibility is too difficult.

`corectl` is a tool for running [CoreOS](https://coreos.com) virtual
machines using OS/X's built-in hypervisor toolkit. To get started, be
sure you have Homebrew installed and then run these commands inside
the sandbox:

``` shell
$ brew update
$ make -f corectl.mk vm
```

This will, in order:

1. Install `corectl` via homebrew.
2. Start up the daemon that manages CoreOS virtual machines,
   `corectld`. At this step you will be asked for your password.
3. Download the latest `alpha` channel CoreOS image.
4. Create and format a persistent disk image in the current directory.
5. Boot the `williamofockham` VM with the persistent disk attached and
   configure Docker for local use with IPv6 enabled.

Once the VM is booted, you can interact with its Docker daemon with
the following:

``` shell
$ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$(corectl q -i williamofockham):2375
```

or

```shell
$ eval `make -f corectl.mk env`
```

and then
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

There should be no containers listed. You are now ready to use Docker
for local development.

### Tweaking the CoreOS configuration

There are a number of environment variables you may change when invoking `make
-f corectl.mk` to change the functionality of the VM:

 * `COREOS_CHANNEL`: (default: `alpha`) You can choose `beta` or `stable` update
   channels for CoreOS.
 * `CORECTL_VOLUME_SIZE`: (default: `40GiB`) The size of the QCOW2 image that
   will be created to store the Docker host's container images and state.
 * `CORECTL_VM_NAME`: (default: `williamofockham`) The name of the CoreOS VM to be
   created.
 * `CORECTL_CPUS`: (default: `2`) The number CPU cores to allocate to the
   virtual machine.
 * `CORECTL_RAM`: (default: `4096`) The amount of RAM to allocate to the virtual
   machine, in megabytes.
 * `CORECTL_VOLUME`: (default: `williamofockham-docker.img.qcow2`) The filename of the
   QCOW2 image that will be created to store the Docker host's container images
   and state.
 * `CORECTL_INIT`: (default: `corectl/cloud-init.yaml`) A `cloud-init` file used
   to configure the virtual machine on startup.
 * `CORECTL_KERNEL_FLAGS`: (default: `hugepages=1024`) Boot arguments to the
   Linux kernel in the virtual machine, which you can use to enable, disable, or
   configure certain operating system features.

### SSH'ing and Destroying the vm

If you need to connect to the VM, for example to get the configured
IPv6 address, use `corectl ssh williamofockham`.

To shutdown and destroy the VM and its persistent storage, run `make
-f corectl.mk destroy`.

### Caveats

* `corectl` has not been updated recently and so it has not taken into
  account the latest signature key for validating CoreOS
  images. `corectl.mk` circumvents this by fetching the image manually
  into the appropriate directories and passes the `-o` (offline) flag
  when running VMs to bypass the built-in fetching behavior.
